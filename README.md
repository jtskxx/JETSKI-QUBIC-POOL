🌊Jetski-Qubic-Pool🌊

This is the main client from Qubic.li, designed to connect to the Jetski Pool Qubic. It links up with the backend API and retrieves tasks to execute. 

➡️The pool applies a 6% fee to the total rewards earned by the computors. This fee covers the costs of operating our Qubic computer nodes, which are hosted in a data center, as well as management expenses.

➡️This version of the Qli miner comes preconfigured to link up with the pool. You just need to update your alias with your account name and your worker's name.
For instance: "ACCOUNTNAME-WORKERNAME"

➡️You can check your rig's stats using the dashboard. Ensure you filter your rigs so that only yours are displayed.

🤝I've made sure this pool maintains 100% transparency with my miners, which is why everything, including miners, IDs, revenue, etc., is accessible publicly.


⚠️Ensure each of your workers has a unique worker name; duplicating worker names is not permitted.⚠️

🌴Feel free to ask me any questions. You can ping me on the Qubic server @jetskki🌴
